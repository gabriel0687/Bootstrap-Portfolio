    <p>My name is Jesus Vasquez....as the title says. I was born in Venezuela back in June 6, 1987 in a awesome city called Maracaibo. When i was a kid i always liked to play sports and meet new friends but</p>
    <p>my destiny was something else, something more exiting like saving the city...well, we'll get to that in another paragraph. I'm the oldest brother of 4 and the better looking one, as people can see DUH.</p>
    <p>But anyway, I live in USA now, I came to Florida when I was a little kid, since then I learned the language and met a lot of cool people...some jerks too but thats normal nowdays lol.</p>
